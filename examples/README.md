Examples
========

This directory contains a handful of examples of basic usage of scrapligo. Note that scrapligo 
follows a fairly similar style/approach that it's Python predecessor laid out -- there are 
"generic" drivers, "network" drivers, and "netconf" drivers. You should take a look at the 
"generic" drivers section first, even if you know you only want to do NETCONF operations -- the 
reason for this is the network and netconf drivers build on/expand on the generic driver so many 
of the options or settings you may care about are showcased in the generic driver examples.
